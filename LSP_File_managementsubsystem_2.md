# File Management Subsystem
- File management susbsystem is responsible for File I/O operations.
- In PCB there is member called **file descriptor table** or **fd table** , it is maintained by file management subsystem.
- fd table keep track of opened file information.
- In fdtable each index will contains file descriptor associated with opened file.
- **interview question** - what are default file descriptors which are opened in executable file...?
  - By Default 0th, 1st ,2nd index of fdtable are already opened with stdin , stdout ,stderr . First three file descriptors are opened in executable file with stdin,stdout,stderr.
- All these stdin,stdout,stderr are associated with console shell prompt.
  - Any input you are taking from linux shell or terminal is through stdin.
  - Any output you are printing in linux shell or terminal is through stdout.
  - Any error you are printing in linux shell or terminal is through stderr.
- **interview question** - who is going to open these three fd's ..?
  - when you start to execute a program , example : "./a.out".
  - we will start from console or terminal , **linux shell or terminal  is parent process of ./a.out**.
  - most of contents(including fd table) of parent's PCB copied to child PCB.
